Real Estate Market in Metropolitan cities of India: price driven by property size or location?


This project is a perfect example of Exploratory Data Analysis wherein I've tried to Analyse the 
Indian Real Estate Market and find whether the prices of the property is influenced by its location or the size.

It takes into account two important Question
1. Which city has the most expensive real estate market?
2. Is there a relationship between home size and price?

I've done the necessary data cleaning on every metropolitan city's dataset. 
As, we are focusing only on 3 things i.e. price, location, size... 
I've created a subset dataframe and concatenated all the dataset of the cities. 
Next, through visualisations, I tried exploring the relationships between them and draw a conclusion. 

# In The Indian Real Estate Market, The property prices are driven by Location of the property and the size of the property cannot be a reliable observation to calculate the price of the property.
